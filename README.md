RaceTrack Cache Explorations
============================

## Introduction

A Secondary Cache design specifically for RaceTrack memory (domain-wall memory (DWM)).

This project is course project for Peking University Computer Orignization class.

* A L2-Cache simulator will be implemented.
* A reference design for RaceTrack Memery Cache will be implemented.
* A design provided by us with improved performance.
* A few benchmark adoped from spec2006 will be used to demonstrate the improvements.
